# Cognitive Background

## Core Cognitive Phenomenon: Cognitive Fatigue

Cognitive fatigue refers to a state of reduced mental efficiency caused by sustained cognitive effort without sufficient recovery. It is characterized by diminished attention, slower processing speed, impaired working memory, and reduced executive control.

In modern digital environments, cognitive fatigue is increasingly driven by prolonged interaction with attention demanding interfaces such as social media feeds, notification systems, and multitasking platforms.

## Why Cognitive Fatigue Matters

Cognitive fatigue directly affects:
- Attention span and focus
- Learning efficiency
- Emotional regulation
- Decision making quality

In everyday life, this manifests as difficulty concentrating while studying, mental exhaustion after screen use, irritability, and reduced motivation. Over time, repeated exposure to cognitively taxing interfaces can contribute to chronic stress and decreased wellbeing.

## Role of Attention and Working Memory

Human working memory is limited to approximately 4 meaningful chunks of information at a time. Sustained attention requires continuous neural resources and metabolic support. When interfaces demand constant monitoring, rapid switching, or prediction, working memory becomes overloaded.

Without recovery periods, attentional systems degrade, leading to cognitive fatigue.

## Relevance to This Project

This project investigates cognitive fatigue as an emergent outcome of interaction behavior. Rather than treating fatigue as a purely subjective state, it is modeled as a measurable consequence of interface driven cognitive load.

By linking behavioral interaction patterns to fatigue outcomes, the project bridges cognitive psychology and computational modeling.
