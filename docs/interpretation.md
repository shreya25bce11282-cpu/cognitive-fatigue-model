# Interpretation of Model Results

## Model Overview

A linear regression model was trained to predict cognitive fatigue based on interaction features. Linear regression was chosen to preserve interpretability, allowing direct cognitive interpretation of coefficients.

## Key Findings

### Late Night Usage
Late night interaction showed the strongest positive association with fatigue. This aligns with research showing reduced executive control and attentional regulation during circadian low points.

---

### Interaction Density
High interaction density significantly increased predicted fatigue, supporting cognitive load theory which posits that rapid information processing overwhelms working memory capacity.

---

### Task Switching
Frequent task switching contributed meaningfully to fatigue, reflecting the cumulative cost of attentional reorientation.

---

### Notifications
Notification exposure increased fatigue, highlighting the role of extraneous cognitive load introduced by interface interruptions.

---

### Session Duration and Scroll Events
Session duration showed a modest effect, while scroll events had minimal standalone impact. This suggests that *how* users interact may matter more than *how long* they interact.

---

## Cognitive Interpretation

The model supports a key principle from cognitive psychology: fatigue emerges not simply from time spent, but from sustained attentional demand, fragmentation, and lack of recovery.

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates how interface level design decisions can be translated into measurable cognitive outcomes using machine learning. It bridges:

**Cognitive Psychology → Behavioral Interaction → Machine Learning**

and illustrates how interpretable models can inform cognitively aligned design.
